                Iâ€™m <b>MARCUS PEH</b>, a final year Computer Science undergraduate at the National 
                University of Singapore. My passion lies in software engineering, and I find 
                joy in writing code to tackle practical challenges. From my early days of 
                programming in Python during National Service, I have been captivated by the 
                ability of software to solve real-world problems. I firmly believe in the 
                transformative power of programming, and I am dedicated to leveraging it to 
                enhance the lives of people globally.

                I find great satisfaction in tackling complex problems and devising efficient 
                and scalable solutions. In fact, during a previous internship, I successfully 
                enhanced API performance by an astounding 200x, which highlighted my ability 
                to optimize systems and improve overall efficiency.
